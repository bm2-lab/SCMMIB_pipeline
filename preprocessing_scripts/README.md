# data preprocessing scripts.


Get_GAM_*.R: calculate gene activity matrix with CreateGeneActivityMatrix or GeneActivity function.
make_fragment_from_bam.sh: generate fragment files for GeneActivity function.
Get_SCTransform_and_LSI.R: perform separate normalization step for few algorithms.

Data_simulation folder includes dataset specific preprocessing code for from raw data to h5ad (python) and full data h5ad to simulation datasets (R).
